  <!-- To add a picture of yourself:
     1. Get an image.
     2. Put it into this file: ~caj50/public_html/photo.gif. 
     3. Make the file available for reading by others. To do this
        type: chmod og+r ~caj50/public_html/photo.gif
        ...at a UNIX shell prompt.
     4. Add the following line after these comments:
        <p><img src="photo.gif" title="My face!" alt=""></p>
        The text in between the quotes after the "alt=" bit is what is
        seen by folks without images or using text-only viewing
        devices such as lynx. For decorative images it should probably 
        be nothing, for information images such as diagrams it should
        be the textual representation of that image (not usually a
        description!). The 'title' attribute says what should appear
        when the mouse cursor hovers over the image.
