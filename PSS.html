    <td>The Noisy Image and the Regulariser and Me</td>
    <td>I love minimising functions. I also love imaging problems. In this talk I motivate how you can phrase denoising images as a minimisation problem. The types of functions that I want to minimise typically involve some unknown parameters that need to be specified beforehand. While there are some general methods on how you can go about choosing said parameters, here I motivate bilevel optimisation, a framework in which you can determine suitable parameter values - and the topic of my PhD! I will cover some cute heuristics and theoretical results and promise to include many pictures of my dog(s).</td>

    <td>Calculus of Variations in L<sup>&infin;</sup></td>
    <td>What is the shortest path between two points? How much land can you enclose with a given amount of fencing? What happens to an elastic rod if we try and bend it? What shape do we get if we dip a wire frame in soapy water? Why are red blood cells biconcave discs? Which donut has the lowest energy?

The answers to such questions can be found in the field of calculus of variations, which concerns the minimisation of functionals: that is, we want to find the function which minimises some given quantity, usually an integral. Calculus of Variations in L∞, on the other hand, also known as L∞ CoV, focuses on problems where the functional we want to minimise is not an integral but instead a supremum (an L<sup>&infin;</sup> norm). Because integral functionals are sensitive to small changes-- i.e. they are differentiable-- and supremal functionals are not, the theory of L<sup>&infin;</sup> CoV is very different to the usual theory, as in fact the main tool we use to solve problems is no longer available!

In this talk, given at a level such that it is accessible for those without a deep analysis background, I will discuss some of the history and motivation behind L<sup>&infin;</sup> CoV problems and introduce the so-called L<sup>p</sup> approximation, a common tool used to solve L<sup>&infin;</sup> problems. I will go through some specific examples to give a feeling of how variational problems work, while sweeping all the technical analysis underneath the rug, and I will discuss how my own research fits into the wider picture.</td>

    <td>How to do OK at GeoGuessr with simple statistics (and 3 CPU years of data processing)</td>
    <td>GeoGuessr is a popular online game where players guess locations based on Google Street View imagery: the closer you get to the actual location, the more points you score. The problem of geolocating a photograph is challenging for humans (play the game to see for yourself), but can computers do any better? I will show how a very simple learning algorithm, k-nearest neighbours, has been applied to the problem and discuss various statistical concepts that arise along the way.</td>

These viscoelastic materials arise almost everywhere, from the tendons in your body, right through to the Earth’s tectonic plates!</td>

    <td>Defensive symbionts and me: an unexpected tale about an uneasy alliance</td>
    <td>Most complex organisms can be infected by pathogens, a common class of which are parasites. These lovely critters require a host in order to reproduce by utilising their host's bodies and cells, causing damage and possibly death. On the other hand, defensive symbionts work to protect the host and in return, gain an increased ability to reproduce and transmit. This mutualistic arrangement can evolve to become more or less protective towards the host depending on conditions. On this sunny/rainy/cloudy (delete as appropriate) Thursday morning, I will let you know what happens when a defensive symbiont and parasite go to battle in a population of hosts. We will find out if both can coexist or if one kills the other off, and we will see if the defensive symbiont decides to protect the host at all or whether it thinks better of it. Finally, we will establish what the effect of this is on the host population, and whether the hosts become stronger from their uneasy alliance, or if they are better off suffering from the parasite alone.</td>

    <td>Extremism, segregation and oscillatory states emerge through collective opinion dynamics in a novel agent-based model</td>
    <td>Humans are pretty complex creatures. Well, some of us at least. And so the way we think and form opinions is undoubtedly even more complex, we couldn't possibly begin to quantify and recreate all of the underlying mechanisms and processes that go into opinion formation. Enter mathematician. In this PSS, I'll be talking you through (and simultaneously reminding myself of) the emergent phenomena produced by an agent-based model of human opinion dynamics. Despite it's simplicity and limiting assumptions, the model is capable of mimicking many socio-psychological phenomena including consensus, segregation, extremism and oscillatory states. So, can we really use mathematics to accurately model the collective behaviour of human opinion dynamics? Maybe I'll let you form your own opinion on that after you've endured my talk. Exit mathematician, pursued by a bear.</td>
