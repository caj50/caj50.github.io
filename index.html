  <!-- To add a picture of yourself:
     1. Get an image.
     2. Put it into this file: ~caj50/public_html/photo.gif. 
     3. Make the file available for reading by others. To do this
        type: chmod og+r ~caj50/public_html/photo.gif

     4. Add the following line after these comments:
        <p><img src="photo.gif" title="My face!" alt=""></p>
        The text in between the quotes after the "alt=" bit is what is
        seen by folks without images or using text-only viewing
        devices such as lynx. For decorative images it should probably 
        be nothing, for information images such as diagrams it should
        be the textual representation of that image (not usually a
        description!). The 'title' attribute says what should appear
        when the mouse cursor hovers over the image.

<h2>Biography</h2>
<text><p>Welcome to my (sparsely structured) website! If you want to know about me, this is the place! I am originally from a town called Flint in North Wales, but I've lived in Bath on and off for the past five years. My undergraduate degree was a MMath at the University of Bath, and I am currently a member of Cohort 8 at <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/centres-for-doctoral-training/epsrc-centre-for-doctoral-training-in-statistical-applied-mathematics-samba/">SAMBa</a>. My mathematical interests are in fluid dynamics and quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>When I'm not solving equations, I can be found playing video games (Mario Golf is a current favourite), or I can be found playing tuba with the <a href="https://cityofbathbrassband.co.uk">City of Bath</a> brass band. With a previous band, I performed a <a href=https://www.facebook.com/IftonCollieryBand/videos/139003257675580/>video</a> over lockdown, and I even made it onto TV! (See picture).</p>
</text>

<h2>Current Units</h2> 
During my MRes year, I have taken the following units:

<h3>Semester 1</h3>
<ul>
  <li> MA40171: Numerical Solutions of Evolutionary Equations</li>
  <li> MA40189: Applied Statistical Inference</li>
  <li> MA50247: Bayesian and Large Scale Methods</li>
</ul>

<h3>Semester 2</h3>
<ul>
  <li> MA50170 Numerical Solutions of Elliptic PDEs</li>
  <li> MA50215 Specialist Reading Course (Asymptotic Analysis)</li>
  <li> MA50251 Applied Stochastic Differential Equations</li>
</ul>
