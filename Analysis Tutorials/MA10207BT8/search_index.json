"],["lecture-recap.html", "1 Lecture Recap", " 1 Lecture Recap This week, we look at some of the consequences of the Mean Value Theorem! These include a method of calculating limits (L’Hôpital’s Rule) and a method of approximating functions (Taylor’s Theorem). Throughout all of this, we are going to need functions which are at least twice differentiable, and along the way, we will develop some conditions to classify extrema. "],["lhôpitals-rule-1.html", "1.1 L’Hôpital’s Rule 1", " 1.1 L’Hôpital’s Rule 1 When calculating limits of one function divided by another, it is very tempting to apply the algebra of limits, and move on. However, if we look at \\(f(x)/g(x)\\), and take \\(x \\to c\\), say, then a naïve application of the algebra of limits may result in an object of the form \\[\\frac{0}{0}, \\; \\text{or} \\; \\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}.\\] These are known as indeterminate forms, named as such because we can’t assign a value to them. But in cases such as \\[\\lim_{x \\to 3} \\frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3}\\], we know the limit exists (\\(=6\\)), despite the fact that blindly applying AoL gives us \\(0/0\\). Luckily for us, there is a method which can help us find limits in the cases where an indeterminate form arises. This is known as L’Hôpital’s rule: Theorem 1.1: (L’Hôpital’s Rule) Let \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and let \\(f,g: I \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) be differentiable on an open interval \\(I\\) containing \\(c\\). Furthermore, suppose that: \\(\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = 0 = \\lim_{x \\to c} g(x)\\) \\(g&#39;(x) \\neq 0 \\;\\; \\forall x \\in I\\setminus\\lbrace c \\rbrace,\\) and \\(\\lim_{x \\to c} \\frac{f&#39;(x)}{g&#39;(x)}\\) exists. Then \\(\\lim_{x \\to c} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{x \\to c} \\frac{f&#39;(x)}{g&#39;(x)}.\\) Or if you prefer your 17th Century French, de L’Hospital’s rule.↩︎ "],["hints.html", "2 Hints", " 2 Hints As per usual, here’s where you’ll find the problem sheet hints! Remember that \\(\\lvert x - 1\\rvert\\) is not differentiable at \\(x = 1\\). So I would suggest splitting the domain up first to account for this. After doing this, there’s an example in the lecture notes that may come in useful. Try adapting the solutions to ‘Problem Sheet 6, Tutorial Q1’. Some of the ideas used in `Problem Sheet 7, Tutorial Q1’ will be helpful here. Just remember to make sure that the hypotheses are satisfied when applying the Mean Value Theorem! "]]
