Solution. For \\(n\\geq4\\), define \\[a_n = \\frac{1}{n\\ln(n)\\ln(\\ln(n))},\\] and for \\(k\\geq 2\\), define \\[b_k := 2^{k}a_{2^k} = \\frac{2^k}{2^k\\ln(2^k)\\ln(\\ln(2^k))}.\\] Then, by properties of logarithms, \\[\\begin{align*} b_k = \\frac{1}{k\\ln(2)\\ln(k\\ln(2))} = \\frac{1}{k\\ln(2)[\\ln(k) + \\ln(\\ln(2))]}. \\end{align*}\\] Also, for \\(k\\geq 2\\), we know that (under the assumption that \\(\\ln : (0,\\infty) \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) is an increasing function), \\[\\ln(k) \\geq \\ln(2) \\geq \\ln(\\ln(2))).\\] Hence \\[b_k \\geq \\frac{1}{2\\ln(2)k\\ln(k)} =: c_k.\\] From lectures (or by applying the Cauchy condensation test again to \\(c_k\\)), we know that \\(\\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty}c_k\\) diverges. Hence, by comparison (as \\(c_k \\geq 0\\)), we find that \\(\\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} b_k\\) diverges. Finally, by the Cauchy condensation test, we conclude that \\[\\sum_{n=4}^{\\infty} a_n = \\sum_{n=4}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n\\ln(n)\\ln(\\ln(n))} \\quad \\text{diverges.}\\] It turns out that this example is a special case of what is known as a generalised Bertrand series, and itâ€™s quite surprising how general we can make this example!
