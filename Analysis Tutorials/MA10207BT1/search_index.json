"],["sequences-and-convergence.html", "1.1 Sequences and Convergence", " 1.1 Sequences and Convergence 1.1.1 Definition of Convergence To begin, we recall the definition of a sequence: Definition 1.1: (Sequence) A sequence of real numbers is a function \\[\\begin{align*} a:\\; &amp;\\mathbb{N} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R},\\\\ &amp;n \\longmapsto a_n. \\end{align*}\\] As you saw last semester, this notation can get pretty annoying, so instead we use the notation \\((a_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\). If it’s clear from the context what set we’re indexing over, we can even just write \\((a_n)_n\\). Since the natural numbers forms a countably infinite set, a sequence gives us a countably infinite list of real numbers. Sometimes it’s interesting to look at the ‘long-term’ behaviour of this list, which gives us the idea of convergence: Definition 1.2: (Sequence Convergence) A sequence \\((a_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\) converges to a real number \\(L\\) as \\(n \\longrightarrow \\infty\\), written as either \\(a_n \\longrightarrow L\\), or \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}a_n = L\\) if \\[\\forall \\epsilon &gt; 0, \\; \\exists N = N(\\epsilon) \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\; \\text{such that} \\; \\forall n \\geq N, \\; \\lvert a_n - L \\rvert &lt; \\epsilon.\\] Loosely speaking, this says that no matter how close you want the sequence to get to \\(L\\), you will always be able to find some point in the sequence after which all points in the sequence will be as close to \\(L\\) as you wanted. 1.1.2 Tests for Convergence Using the definition to prove sequence convergence (or otherwise) for every possible sequence is incredibly tedious. So what we really want is some criteria or tests which make these proofs much easier. You’ll find some of these tests below. The first test is the sandwich/pinching/squeeze theorem: Theorem 1.1: (Sandwich Theorem) Suppose that \\((a_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\, , \\, (b_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\, , \\, (c_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\) are real sequences. If \\(a_n \\leq b_n \\leq c_n \\quad \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), and \\(\\exists L \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\[\\begin{align*} \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n = L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} c_n, \\end{align*}\\] then \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty}b_n = L\\). In words, this says that if you can ‘trap’ the sequence under consideration between two other sequences which converge to a common limit, then all three sequences involved will converge to the same limit. The second test is known as the Growth Factor Test, and aims to determine convergence by comparing the ratio of successive terms in a sequence: Theorem 1.2: (Growth Factor Test) Let \\((a_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\) be a real sequence with \\(a_n&gt;0 \\; \\forall n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\), and with \\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = r.\\] Then: If \\(r &lt; 1\\), \\(a_n \\to 0\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). If \\(r &gt; 1\\), \\(a_n \\to \\infty\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). If \\(r = 1\\), the test is inconclusive. Note that this test won’t work if the terms of the sequence \\((a_n)_n\\) are given by ratios of polynomials (can you see/prove why?) These two tests are good at proving convergence, but is there a quick way of proving non-convergence? As you’ve seen before, we can do this using subsequences: Definition 1.3: (Subsequence) Let \\((a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\) be a real sequence, and let \\((n_k)_{k\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\) be a strictly increasing sequence. Then \\((a_{n_k})_{k\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\) is called a subsequence of \\((a_n)\\). Using these subsequences to prove non-convergence relies on the contrapositive of the following proposition: Proposition 1.3: If a real sequence \\((a_n)_n\\) converges to a limit \\(L\\), then all subsequences \\((a_{n_k})_k\\) of \\((a_n)_n\\) also converge to \\(L\\). Namely, if there exists two subsequences converging to different limits, then the original sequence does not converge! "],["series-and-convergence.html", "1.2 Series and Convergence", " 1.2 Series and Convergence The mathematics in this section is nothing new either — it’s really just sequences in disguise. Given a sequence \\((a_n)_n\\), one thing we can do is add up all the terms and see what happens. This leads on to the idea of an (infinite) series: Definition 1.4: (Series) Let \\((a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\) be a real sequence. Then \\[\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} a_n\\] is called a series for \\((a_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\). So when does this series converge? In other words, when is this object a real number? To answer these questions, we have the following definition: Definition 1.5: (Series Convergence and Partial Sums) Let \\((a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\) be a real sequence. Then \\(\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} a_n\\) converges if and only if the sequence \\((S_N)_{N \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\) converges, where \\[S_N:= \\sum_{n = 1}^{N} a_n\\] is the \\(N\\) partial sum. If \\(S_N \\to \\ell\\) as \\(N \\to \\infty\\), we define \\[\\ell = \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}a_n.\\] Much like with proving sequence convergence, using the definition each time you want to `evaluate’ a series can get tedious really quickly. Therefore, we really want a couple of tests which can prove convergence without too much hassle. The first of these tests involves comparing the sizes of two series, and is aptly known as the comparison test. Theorem 1.4: (Comparison Test) Let \\((a_n)_n\\) and \\((b_n)_n\\) be real sequences, and suppose that there exists a \\(M \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\(\\lvert a_n \\rvert \\leq b_n \\;\\forall n \\geq M.\\) Then, if \\(\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} b_n\\) is convergent, \\(\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} a_n\\) is convergent. Naturally, using this, we can also build a test for divergence to \\(\\infty\\) out of the comparison test too. Corollary 1.1: Let \\((a_n)_n\\) and \\((b_n)_n\\) be real sequences. If there exists a \\(M \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\(0 \\leq a_n \\leq b_n \\; \\forall n \\geq M\\), and \\(\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} a_n\\) diverges, then \\(\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} b_n\\) diverges. The second test we look at here is similar to the Growth Factor test (Theorem 1.2), in that it assesses convergence of a series by examining the ratio of successive terms: Theorem 1.5: (D’Alembert’s Ratio Test) Let \\((a_n)_n\\) be a real sequence with \\(a_n \\neq 0 \\; \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Suppose \\[\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\lvert a_{n+1}\\rvert}{\\lvert a_n\\rvert} = r.\\] Then: If \\(0 \\leq r &lt; 1\\), \\(\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} a_n\\) converges. If \\(r &gt; 1\\), then \\(\\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} a_n\\) diverges. If \\(r = 1\\), the test is inconclusive. Again, this test fails if the series terms are formed of ratios of polynomials. The final test presented here is applicable when the terms of the series alternate in sign: Theorem 1.6: (Leibniz Alternating Series Test) Suppose \\((a_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\) is a decreasing sequence tending to \\(0\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). Then \\[\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (-1)^n a_n\\] is a convergent series. "],["sets-and-bounds.html", "1.3 Sets and Bounds", " 1.3 Sets and Bounds The final topic we are going to re-cover here involves sets of real numbers, and deciding on whether we can ‘trap’ these sets between an upper bound \\(M\\) — so that no member of the set lies above \\(M\\) — and a lower bound \\(m\\) — so that no member of the set lies below \\(m\\). This gives rise to the defintion of a bounded set, as is seen below: Definition 1.6: (Upper Bound) Let \\(S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\). Then \\(M \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is an upper bound for \\(S\\) if for all \\(x \\in S\\), \\(x \\leq M\\). In this case, we say \\(S\\) is bounded above. Definition 1.7: (Lower Bound) Let \\(S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\). Then \\(m \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is a lower bound for \\(S\\) if for all \\(x \\in S\\), \\(x \\geq m\\). In this case, we say that \\(S\\) is bounded below. Definition 1.8: (Bounded Set) A set \\(S\\) is bounded if it is both bounded above and below. Equivalently, \\(S\\) is bounded if there exists \\(m, M \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that for all \\(x \\in S\\), \\(m\\leq x \\leq M\\). Thinking of upper bounds for a moment, if we have one, we could ask if there is a smaller number which also bounds the set from above. You might also be tempted to ask what the ‘best’ upper bound on a set could be, such that no smaller number will bound the set from above. This leads to the ideas of suprema and (analogously for lower bounds) infima: Definition 1.9: (Supremum) Let \\(S \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). A number \\(T \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is said to be the supremum of \\(S\\) if it is an upper bound for \\(S\\), and for any other upper bound \\(M\\), \\(T \\leq M\\). Here, we write \\(T = \\sup(S)\\). Definition 1.10: (Infimum) Let \\(S \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). A number \\(t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is said to be the infimum of \\(S\\) if it is a lower bound for \\(S\\), and for any other lower bound \\(m\\), \\(t\\geq m\\). Here, we write \\(t = \\inf(S)\\). Finally, we can alternatively characterise the supremum/infimum of a set as follows: Proposition 1.7: Let \\(S\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}\\). Then a number \\(T\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) is the supremum of \\(S\\), denoted \\(\\sup(S)\\) if: \\[\\forall \\epsilon &gt; 0, \\exists s \\in S\\; \\text{such that} \\; s &gt; T - \\epsilon.\\] Proposition 1.8: Let \\(S\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}\\). Then a number \\(t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) is the infimum of \\(S\\), denoted \\(\\inf(S)\\) if: \\[\\forall \\epsilon &gt; 0, \\exists s \\in S\\; \\text{such that} \\; s &lt; t + \\epsilon.\\] "],["hints.html", "2 Hints", " 2 Hints In this section, you’ll find hints for the current week’s problem sheet.
