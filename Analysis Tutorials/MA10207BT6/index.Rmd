# Lecture Recap
This week, we're starting to look at the derivative of a function. Along the way, we'll see some tricks for making differentiation easier, and we'll cover a way of finding the derivative of inverse functions.

## Differentiation
While functions are very good at describing physical quantities such as temperature, density or momentum we can usually gain more insight into these variables by studying how fast they change at a given position or time. Mathematically, we study rates of change using derivatives, which again relies on the ideas behind limits!

```{definition, label = "def1", name = "Derivative"}
Let $f: D \to \mathbb{R}$, where $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is an open set, and let $c \in D$. Then, if $\exists L \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $$\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(c+h) - f(c)}{h} = L,$$ we say that $f$ is differentiable at $c$, and call $L$ the derivative of $f$ at $c$.
```
We can note a few things here:

*  Firstly, if this $L$ exists, we write it as $f'(c)$ to make it clear that its a derivative.
*  We require $D$ to be open, so that we can actually take limits! If, for example, $D = [-1,2]$, we could attempt to define the derivative at any point in the interior of $D$, $D^{\circ} = (-1,2)$, but we couldn't define the derivative at $x = -1$ or $x = 2$.[^4]
*  Substituting $x = c+h$ into the definition gives us an equivalent formulation: $f$ is differentiable at $c$ if there exists $L\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $$\lim_{x \to c}\frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c} = L.$$

One quick result we obtain from this definition is the following:
```{proposition, label = "prop1"}
If a function $f:D \to \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable at a point $c$, then it is continuous at $c$.
```
The contrapositive of this is very useful for ruling functions out: if a function is **not** continuous, it is not differentiable. As a further remark, or warning, **continuity does not imply differentiability**! To see this, think of either $f(x) = \lvert x \rvert$ at $x = 0$, or look up the [Weierstrass function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_function). 

[^4]: There is nothing stopping us; however, trying to define *left* and *right derivatives* at these points, i.e. we could search for $$\lim_{x \to -1^{+}}\frac{f(-1+h) - f(-1)}{h}\;\;\text{or}\;\;\lim_{x \to 2^{-}}\frac{f(2+h) - f(2)}{h}.$$

## Rules of Differentiation {#diff}
Since everything inside the limit defining the derivative is just a function (of either $h$ or $x$), we can apply the algebra of limits to deduce a few familiar rules of differentiation:

```{theorem, label = "thm1a", name = "Algebra of Derivatives 1"}
Let $D\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ be an open set, and let $f,g:D \to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable at $c\in D.$ Then the following functions are differentiable at $c$:
  
  1. $f+g$, with $$(f+g)'(c) = f'(c) + g'(c),$$
  2. $Kf$ for any $K\in\mathbb{R}$, with $$(Kf)'(c) = Kf'(c),$$
  
  
```

Using these two rules we can show that the set of functions $f:D\to\mathbb{R}$ which are differentiable at $c$ form a vector space. In fact, since differentiability implies continuity, and the zero function $0:D \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $0(x) = 0$ is also differentiable at $c$, this set forms a vector subspace of the set of functions $f:D \to \mathbb{R}$ which are continuous at $c$.

There are three further rules which make up the Algebra of Derivatives:

```{theorem, label = "thm1b", name = "Algebra of Derivatives 2"}
Let $D\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ be an open set, and let $f,g:D \to \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable at $c\in D.$ Then the following functions are differentiable at $c$:
  
  3. (Product rule) $fg$, with $$(fg)'(c) = f'(c)g(c) + f(c)g'(c),$$
  4. For $g(c)\neq0$, $1/g$, with $$\left(\frac{1}{g}\right)'(c) = \frac{-g'(c)}{g(c)^2}.$$
  5. (Quotient rule) For $g(c)\neq0$, $f/g$ with $$\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)'(c) = \frac{f'(c)g(c)-f(c)g'(c)}{g(c)^2}.$$
  
  
```

One thing to note here is that we can obtain the quotient rule by applying the product rule to the functions $f$ and $1/g$, which saves you having to learn the proof!

### Chain Rule
The one thing we've said nothing about so far is whether a composition of functions is differentiable. This result is what is known as the (familiar) chain rule:

```{theorem, label = "thm2", name = "Chain Rule"}
Let $g:(a,b) \to \mathbb{R}$ and $f:(A,B) \to \mathbb{R}$ be such that $g\left((a,b)\right) \subseteq (A,B).$ Assume that $g$ is differentiable at $c$ and $f$ is differentiable at $g(c)$. Then the composition $f\circ g$ is differentiable at $c$ with $$\left(f\circ g\right)'(c) = f'\left(g(c)\right)g'(c).$$
```

# Hints
As per usual, here's where you'll find the problem sheet hints!

1) There are a couple of ways to do this, but in each, you need to calculate the limit of the difference quotient when $c=0$, i.e. $$\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{f(x) - f(0)}{x - 0}.$$ Try using sequences for this one (or if you've seen it, the function version of the pinching theorem)
2)  The following formula may come in handy:$$\max(f(x),g(x)) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\lvert f(x) - g(x) \rvert + f(x) + g(x)\right).$$
    For the function examples, try and find $f,g$ such that $$\max(f(x),g(x)) = \lvert x \rvert.$$
3) Using $p(x) = (x-a)q(x)$, what does $p'(x)$ give you?
